# 🧠 Brain Tumor Analysis 

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **brain tumor MRI scans** . By leveraging medical imaging data, we perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to extract insights and identify patterns.

## 📂 Dataset Information
The dataset consists of MRI scan images categorized into two classes:
- **Tumor** – Images showing the presence of a brain tumor.
- **No Tumor** – Images without any brain tumor.

Each image is processed and analyzed to understand the distribution and characteristics of tumors.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We perform various **data preprocessing and visualization techniques**, including:
- **Image Preprocessing:** Resizing, grayscale conversion, and normalization.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Understanding the pixel intensity distributions.
- **Visualization:** Using Matplotlib & Seaborn to analyze the dataset and identify patterns.

## 🔧 Installation & Requirements
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn opencv-python
```
Alternatively, open and run **Jupyter Notebook** (`Brain Tumor Prediction.ipynb`).

## 🚀 Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```
2. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Run `Brain Tumor Prediction.ipynb` to preprocess images and perform EDA.

## 📊 Project Features
- **MRI Image Preprocessing & Analysis**
- **Statistical Insights & Data Visualization**
- **Comparative Study on Tumor vs. Non-Tumor Data**

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Expand dataset for more diverse analysis.
- Implement more advanced image processing techniques.
- Build an interactive dashboard for visualization.
